# Blood-Group-Detection-via-fingerprint
This project aims to detect a person's blood group using fingerprint images. It involves training a deep learning model on a dataset of fingerprint images labeled with different blood groups (A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, AB+, AB-). The system integrates a web-based UI for user registration, fingerprint scanning, and blood group prediction.
